#### Next Js 1 💥 ####
nex.config.mjs-> url ,features we use That Will Be Defined 

import ## '../../../components/*.js' => '@components/*.js' search in src directory

App ROute Allowss us To easily Navigate Pages using app directory 
(auth) folder shouldnt need to access by nexted routes ❌/auth/login 👉/login directly can be accessed

layout.jsx = whaterver  we write that will be shown to every page(Layout component in React, Only Our COntent Chnages  ➡ {children} ) ⭐common components Using Layout

suggests to include only api Routes/pages IN app dir
src => libraries ,auth configs
if component ❌page.jsx , if page then needed
Link component will fetch component before we click so renders Faster

got issue -> error.jsx mut be client Component

module.css = to prevent confusion bw global css and 

using <img srv='' /> it will not optimize so it has slow LCP,high bandwidth=> nextjs Image <Image src=''/> 
It Caches image 1st for optimizing image for different sizes



Next Js Doesnt Allow External Url -> next.config.mjs add remotePatterns


2types for Rendering-SSR and CSR

when request from user id Made At That Time Browser Page Is Empty -> server creates html file and send it in response 
server takes this request

SSR html is not interactive , Browser has to download Js file
waiting for interactivity from server

CSR - empty html and Js Bundle That will Build web From scratch 
as soon as page is ready , we will interact

React -default rendering on client side Only

In Next We CAn combine server and client side components
-> use client directive on top of component to make it as clinet component

initial load for client component even at server

when we wrap server component as client component it still willl be server component bcoz sometime we have wrap components with providers(auth,context)

created clientSideProvider that gotwraped by entire application

even if the some component wrapped with  client component , dont worry it is'n t clinent component

*********** Navigation **************

default Behaviour of Link is Prefetch Page ,but if more components are there Then we Can Disable That Functionality
<Link href='/' prefetch={false} >Home </Link>

router.push() => will add new Entry to Browser History Stack
router.replace() => contain only 1 entry of given path
usePathname shows url path not query of url

Bydefault NextJs Caches The APi Responses
in fetch('', {cachre:'force-cache'}) => fetch('', {cachre:'no-store'})

if we update blogs every week then use cache and revalidate duration3600 secornds(1hr ) -it refresh the for every 1 hour 
        const res=await fetch( 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts', { next: { revalidate: 3600 } } );

***************************************************************
/**** Getting Started WIth MongoDb **************'
npm i mongoose@8.0.0 version

problem - we using dev mode ,whenerver we refresh it makes new connection

APi Data Gets Cached But for fetch we can specify {no-store} but for other Other APi How We do noStore() => unstable_noStore


*************************************SEO ******************************

For Better SEO we given Dynamic title ,desc => metadata for each pages accordingly

*************** Server Actions ***************
'use server' directive ,and fn() should be async
