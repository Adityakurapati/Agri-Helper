#### Next Js 1 💥 ####
nex.config.mjs-> url ,features we use That Will Be Defined 

import ## '../../../components/*.js' => '@components/*.js' search in src directory

App ROute Allowss us To easily Navigate Pages using app directory 
(auth) folder shouldnt need to access by nexted routes ❌/auth/login 👉/login directly can be accessed

layout.jsx = whaterver  we write that will be shown to every page(Layout component in React, Only Our COntent Chnages  ➡ {children} ) ⭐common components Using Layout

suggests to include only api Routes/pages IN app dir
src => libraries ,auth configs
if component ❌page.jsx , if page then needed
Link component will fetch component before we click so renders Faster

got issue -> error.jsx mut be client Component

module.css = to prevent confusion bw global css and 

using <img srv='' /> it will not optimize so it has slow LCP,high bandwidth=> nextjs Image <Image src=''/> 
It Caches image 1st for optimizing image for different sizes
